SmartWatch Redux
================

Modern replacements for the DS1216 SmartWatch variants.

SmartWatchRedux-E
-----------------

A replacement for the DS1216-E. This SmartWatch is for use on a BIOS
or exapansion ROM socket. It is typically placed in between an existing
BIOS ROM and its socket.

This clock is compatible with Y2K and current dates when used with this
software availalbe here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/kctqpwzjxgymfz9/smwy2k.zip?dl=0

ATD-20-Redux
------------

A replacement for the ATD-20 clock. This is used in ATD exansion boards 
for the Tandy 1000 computers such as the T512CLK-A1. It is believed that
the ATD-20 is, or is compatible with, the DS1216-C SmartWatch. However, 
the ATD-20 does not allow, nor require, a BIOS rom to be fitted to the 
top of the module.

A DS1216-C has been tested in a T512CLK-A1 and works fine. If purchasing
a DS1216-C today, it may be necessary to retrofit a battery replacement.
Google "DS1216 battery replacement". 

Software for the ATD-20 (or DS1216-C) located in a T512CLK-A1 is available
from here: http://www.minuszerodegrees.net/rtc/rtc.htm . Note that this
sofware is not properly compatible with current dates, and so this clock
module is not recommended for use.
