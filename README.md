SmartWatch Redux
================

Modern replacements for the DS1216 SmartWatch variants.

SmartWatchRedux-E
-----------------

A replacement for the DS1216-E. This SmartWatch is for use on a BIOS
or exapansion ROM socket. It is typically placed in between an existing
BIOS ROM and its socket.

ATD-20-Redux
------------

A replacement for the ATD-20 clock. This is used in ATD exansion boards 
for the Tandy 1000 computers such as the T512CLK-A1. It is believed that
the ATD-20 is, or is compatible with, the DS1216-C SmartWatch. However, 
the ATD-20 does not allow, nor require, a BIOS rom to be fitted to the 
top of the module.
